## What is this?

Essentially, this is a private server for Yo-kai Watch Puni Puni written in C#. It can be hosted by anyone, anywhere as a drop-in replacement for NHN's servers. This allows everyone to play even after the servers shut down. Additionally, you can have full control over your experience by modifying the code.
